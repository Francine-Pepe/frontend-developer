I love to create stuff, and that is why I first worked as a Fashion Designer for almost 10 years. After moving to Germany, I felt like changing my career as well, but I still wanted to continue working creatively, so, here I am creating beautiful and functional Websites and Apps. I am passionate about Visual Design, colors, animation, photography - so, basically anything that involves a visual concept! On PROJECTS you will be able to see a little bit of my work, where I tried to give my best, and where I learned more and more about this world called Web Development :D ",

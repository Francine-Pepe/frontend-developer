I love to create stuff, and that is why I first worked as a Fashion Designer for almost 10 years. After moving to Germany, I felt like changing my career as well, but I still wanted to continue working creatively, so, here I am creating beautiful and functional Websites and Apps. I am passionate about Visual Design and Animation, which I guess I express myself in the most effective and clean way. And what do I do? You can find out bellow",

I am an open-minded, creative, and hard-working person, who likes to work in groups ( which I think is very important for us to exchange experiences - I learned a lot working in groups, with different people each week ), but enjoys working by herself as well ( working alone I can organize better my ideas and thoughts - and listen to good music too. Who doesn't? ).My brief UI experience - while learning - led me to develop important and useful skills, that is, user-friendly, but always taking into account a beautiful and well-made Design."
